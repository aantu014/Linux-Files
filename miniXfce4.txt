systemctl start display-manager  or

X ist started by /etc/init.d/xdm. You can enable it with "systemctl enable xdm.service", but it should be enabled by default anyway.
But maybe you have to set the default target to "graphical" or "runlevel5". Use "systemctl get-default" to see the current setting and run "systemctl set-default graphical.target" to set it accordingly.
Or use YaST->System->Services Manager.
