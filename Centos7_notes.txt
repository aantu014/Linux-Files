Steps for CentOS 7 Virtual Box (Windows 10 host)  

Before running your VirtualBox program, download the Virtual Box guest Additions needed for your kernel from this link: 
http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/

Make sure that you choose the same version as the one for your virtual box (you can find it by pressing help and about virtual box ). 

Press on the version and download, in my case, it is 
VBoxGuestAdditions_5.2.6.iso file

Add VBoxGuestAdditions_5.2.6.iso to a disk on your Centos
- Highlight your OS vm,
- Choose Setting
- Select Storage 
- Add a new disk, and look for your iso file.
- In Controller:IDE there are two options:  
  - Adds optical disk and Adds hard disk. 
  - Choose optical disk 
  - then "choose disk" and add the
    VBoxGuestAdditions_5.2.6.iso
    you previously downloaded.
- Run your VM and click on devices 


Run your machine again, and do the following commands: 
 1. sudo su
 2. vi /etc/default/grub   ***Press I to format the text 
 3. Add vga=792 inside the "-quotes for GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX, f.ex. GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="crashkernel=auto rhgb quiet vga= [NUMBER HERE]"
    [NUMBER HERE] == The value that is equal to your vga resolution, you can find some values here: https://www.pendrivelinux.com/vga-boot-modes-to-set-screen-resolution/
    For example: for a 1024x768x24 the value will be 792. 
	
    Depth	640x480  800x600  1024x768  1152x864  1280x1024  1600x1200
    8 bit	vga=769	 vga=771  vga=773   vga=353   vga=775	 vga=796
   16 bit	vga=785	 vga=788  vga=791   vga=355   vga=794	 vga=798
   24 bit	vga=786	 vga=789  vga=792   vga=795   vga=799
	
	
 4. Press esc and type :wq and hit enter
 5. grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
 6.reboot 

When rebooting your machine you have three options from where you can boot: 
Use the one that is CentOS Linux (3.10.0-862.el7.x86_64) 7 (Core) 
In my computer is the second one. 

Boot and the resolution should be fine. 

NOTE: Is will not be 100% properly adapted to your screen and you will need to use the side navigation bar.

SET Email for CENTOS7:   

The goal here is to use your gmail email account as an SMTP email server to send your emails out

dhclient  /if it is not automatically loading as shown in the dhclient section above


--First go to the gmail account that you want to add to CentOS 7: yum

1.Go to the Less secure apps section of your Google Account.
  https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en
2.Turn on Allow less secure apps. If you don't see this setting, your 
administrator might have turned off less secure app account access.

Open CentOS 7: 

--In the terminal run the following commands: 

dhclient //make sure that you are connected to the net, you can run ping google.com
           to be sure. 
yum -y install postfix cyrus-sasl-plain mailx //Install Postfix with SASL authentication

systemctl restart postfix //restart the service 

systemctl enable postfix //start and boot the service

vi /etc/postfix/main.cf //open the main.cf file that comes with postfix and add 
                          the following lines at the end of the file

                          relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
                          smtp_use_tls = yes
                          smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
                          smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
                          smtp_tls_CAfile = /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt
                          smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
                          smtp_sasl_tls_security_options = noanonymous
                          //save and close the file 

vi /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd //create a new file that will hold your username and 
                              password. Make sure that no one can see your screen
                              at this time. 

                              Add the following line : [smtp.gmail.com]:587 username:password

                              Insert a valid gmail account and password
                              Since we are using the gmail SMTP server, if you are using
                              your gmail acount you can use:
                              examples: joe007:secrect

                              Using other emails:
                              examples: joe007@fiu.edu:secrect
                                   

postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd //generate a postfix lookup table 

chown root:postfix /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*
chmod 640 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*          //restrict the access to the sasl_passwd file
                                               Only root users can acess it now 
systemctl reload postfix               //reload the postfix config. 

echo "This is a test." | mail -s "test message" user@example.net //send a test email to a valid gmail account
                                                                   It can be your account. 

--Check if you have recived an email in your account. If not make sure that your account
and password are correct. 

--You can also run: 
tail -f /var/log/maillog //to review the emails sent. 

debug_peer_list=smtp.gmail.com
debug_peer_level=3             //to check where the error is located 

systemctl reload postfix //reload the system.

--Email with a file attached:

echo "This is a test message" | mail -s Test -a example.txt user@example.com 
//echo "This is a test message" is the body of the email 
//-s Test is the subject 
// -a example.txt the file that you want to attach. Make sure that you send the mail from the directory where the file is located in orde to access that file. 
//user@example.com receiver email account
